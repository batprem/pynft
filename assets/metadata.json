{"description": "It was in 2015, I was an engineer intern.\n    \nI was assigned to code in Python for satellite signal processing.\n\nAt that time, I had no experience with it, but I had completed C#, C and Matlab courses.\n\nIt inspired me to transfer from electrical to software engineer career path.\n\nNow, I partially succeed in software engineering, machine learning and A.I implementation.\n\nThis NFT determines where I started.\n\nMoreover, I minting this NFT with my Solidity code I created by myself.\n\nNo, it's not my first Solidity project :D\n\nBut it's my first Solidity project deployed in `production`.\n\nWhich means this is the starting point for my smart contract development.\n\nSmart contract repository is located in https://github.com/batprem/pynft\n", "external_url": "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUoGY6GbvzSQi2gP7YHtVMRocNW1Xs16ZUHxWcTgWHwJb?filename=fruit-list.py", "image": "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmda8x41dArU36LKveHzSN3NPJjWxFgyeNNLM8uUMqtMNr?filename=my-first-python-code.png", "name": "My first Python code", "attributes": []}
